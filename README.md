# Data-Scientist-Project1

Airbnb is a popular online platform that enables homeowners and apartment owners to offer their properties for short-term stays to travelers. Its user-friendly interface and flexible options have made it a preferred choice among tourists.


To provide valuable insights for both Airbnb hosts and travelers looking to visit Seattle, this Project aimed to analyze the Airbnb Seattle dataset to answer three main business questions:
- What are the review score ratings based on property type ?
- Which neighbourhoods have the highest average listings prices per night?
- Who are the top hosts in terms of total listings count ? What types of listings they own?
